// Package table provides the main interfaces used to manipulate tabular data.
// To understand why we need interfaces to process tabular data, it is useful to introduce
// the concepts of the physical and the logical representation of data.
//
// The physical representation of data refers to the representation of data as text on disk,
// for example, in a CSV, JSON or XML file. This representation may have some type information (JSON,
// where the primitive types that JSON supports can be used) or not (CSV, where all data is
// represented in string form). In this project, those are going to be presented as packages that
// provide structs which implement those interfaces. For instance, csv.NewTable creates a Table
// which is backed up by a CSV.
//
// The logical representation of data refers to the "ideal" representation of the data in terms of
// primitive types, data structures, and relations, all as defined by the specification. We could say
// that the specification is about the logical representation of data. That said, functions
// exported for data processing should deal with logic representations. That functionality
// is represented by interfaces in this package.
